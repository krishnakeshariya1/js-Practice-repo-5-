# Js Based Project  🛒

Small front-end projects built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** to strengthen core JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills.  
This project focuses on **CRUD operations, filtering, searching, cart management, and state handling without any frameworks**.

This is a **learning-first project**, not a UI-heavy or framework-based app.
